&lt;p&gt;
I&apos;ve released a new, short, &lt;em&gt;Wrong Note&lt;/em&gt; piece, called &amp;quot;New Bageon&amp;quot;. It accompanies this post. Listen to it loud.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the first time, I&apos;ve released a high fidelity copy online as well. If you know about the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot;&gt;FLAC&lt;/a&gt; file format, and enjoy hi-fi (as I do), please feel free to download a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/download/newbageon/ear_reverends_new_bageon.flac&quot; rel=&quot;enclosure&quot;&gt;FLAC copy of &amp;quot;New Bageon&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Listen to it even louder! It&apos;s also released under the attribution, non-commercial, share alike &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons license&lt;/a&gt;, so I hope you&apos;ll find some creative, loud, ways to share it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, btw, fyi, if you use iTunes, you can now subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=82375165&amp;amp;s=143441&quot;&gt;Wrong Notes music via iTunes&lt;/a&gt; too!
&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking of copyright, check-out this story about &lt;a href=&quot;http://lawgeek.typepad.com/lawgeek/2005/10/fox_lawyers_cd_.html&quot;&gt;Fox Lawyers C&amp;amp;D Buffy Fandom Musical&lt;/a&gt; (C&amp;amp;D = cease and desist = lawyer speak). Talk about vampires...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Buffy story also references two excellent posts by danah boyd:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/09/29/when_media_beco.html&quot;&gt;when media becomes culture: rethinking copyright issues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/10/08/remix_is_active.html&quot;&gt;remix is active consumption not production (when media becomes culture, part 2)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coincidentally, danah&apos;s is one of the voices played in &lt;a href=&quot;http://earreverends.com/index.html#practices&quot;&gt;Joi vs the Burtonator&lt;/a&gt;, which title is itself a kind-of play on the connections between lawyer speak and (1960s Japanese) monster movie themes (and, there: we&apos;re back to copyright and monsters and slayers...).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back before it was called &amp;quot;podcasting&amp;quot;, this blog was set-up for wrong-note-casting Ear Reverends&apos; music. But, this has exceeded the more limited design of podcasting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I&apos;m starting to update various technology things on this site to make it compatible with other podcast sites. With this post, I hope Wrong Notes will start to appear on sites like Odeo, iTunes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;Yahoo! Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://odeo.com/claim/feed/b61433ddad1d1b84&quot;&gt;My Odeo Channel&lt;/a&gt; (odeo/b61433ddad1d1b84). (I had to stick that link and number in here to get Odeo to give me a channel!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More updates soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(hi all. Sorry for the incredibly long gap in posts. I&apos;m making new music and will have more to post here soon.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Want to mention a great new CD by my musical amigo, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bernardbernard.com&quot;&gt;Bernard Bernard&lt;/a&gt;, which you can now &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdbaby.com/cd/bernardbernard&quot;&gt;listen to and buy on CD Baby&lt;/a&gt;. Here&apos;s my review:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
~~~
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bernard Bernard&apos;s &lt;em&gt;In The Land Of Giants Air Is Flesh&lt;/em&gt; is an album that is equally very accessible and very mysterious, by which I mean you can listen to it once and get totally into it and want everyone to hear it; and you can listen to it over and over again and still find yourself fascinated with it sonically and lyrically and want everyone to hear it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thinking about the album in terms of its mysterious sonic qualities, I might be tempted to compare it to Brian Eno&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Another Green World&lt;/em&gt; and other early albums. But, I&apos;d also want to point out that there is an earthy quality to the Bernard Bernard album that I&apos;m at a loss for words to call, other than &lt;em&gt;the funk&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; with which I might compare Bernard&apos;s album to a 21st century Funkadelic re-imagining their psychedelic masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Maggot Brain&lt;/em&gt;. So, let me make that clear: imagine &lt;em&gt;Another Green World&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Maggot Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Wow!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, taking the &lt;em&gt;Maggot Brain&lt;/em&gt; reference one step further, Bernard&apos;s album has a subtle humor, good feeling, and subversive-freaky-friend groove to it. This is maybe the first thing that will hook you on it, if it&apos;s not a catchy lyric or two that you&apos;ll immediately find yourself humming.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, there are, at the same time, deep piles of interesting musical and lyrical fabric that you will want to explore with each subsequent listen. Sometimes I&apos;m following weaves that seems to have been left by Moondog&apos;s original &lt;em&gt;Theme&lt;/em&gt;; sometimes I&apos;m feeling textures imprinted by Sonic Youth&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Daydream Nation&lt;/em&gt;; sometimes I&apos;m living in the scenes that appear on patches cut out of Tom Waits&apos; &lt;em&gt;Rain Dogs&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; there is a lot to be found in there!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And, this is where I come to again and again: at the same time, &lt;em&gt;In The Land Of Giants Air Is Flesh&lt;/em&gt; is not really like any of these things. It&apos;s an original &amp;mdash; one of the rare, original, beautiful albums that will ever be made &amp;mdash; ever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
~~~
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So, with me, lately:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve moved into a new house in Seattle, and this means I&apos;ve been busy looking, moving, cleaning, unpacking, arranging, rearranging, etc., and half-sleeping a lot lately. But, the music is back! I&apos;m already set-up better than in the last place &amp;mdash; my &lt;em&gt;bAs*Sment studio&lt;/em&gt;, which never quite came together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
~~~
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the projects I&apos;m working on right now, which I&apos;m really excited about, is a stereo mix / master of some music Bernard Bernard and I made together a long time ago, with our friend Eduard Marghidan who is currently doing the (live) electronic music radio blog on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greedysoul.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Greedy Soul&lt;/a&gt; site. I not ready to say much more about this project quite yet, but we&apos;re working towards a full-length CD release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
~~~
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I&apos;ll be updating this site more henceforth. Also, now that things have settled down technology-wise around podcasting, I&apos;ll update this site so that it matches what everyone else is doing in terms of so-called &amp;quot;podcast compatible feeds&amp;quot; (I had hoped that podcasting would come to embrace what I was using on this site, but what I did ended up being a case of being too early to the party and not being noticed when everyone else arrived). I&apos;ll also figure out how to make it all iTunes podcast compatible.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ve been into these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arturia.com/&quot;&gt;Arturia&lt;/a&gt; Vintage synths lately (which I got for my half-birthday &amp;mdash; self-portrait above taken then in the bAs*Sment), and also recording demos of new songs with my acoustic guitar (not pictured, but it looks like one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?q=acoustic%20guitar&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;).

	   <title>What&apos;s up, site anniversary, and podcasting music</title>
	   <link>http://earreverends.com/notes/200412/annivesary_podcast.html</link>
       <description>
&lt;p&gt;
What&apos;s up: I&apos;ve got a couple dozen or so unreleased tracks that I&apos;ve worked on this year, and I&apos;ve been thinking about doing something with them (excerpts?, mashup-medley?) as an end-of-the-year thing for this blog. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During this period at the end of the year, I definitely look back and look forward at my life. And, I&apos;m not sure yet whether I&apos;ll release / post a lot more soon, or incorporate it all into the full &amp;quot;new year&amp;quot; plan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing to say: I&apos;m encouraged to have been able to release &lt;a href=&quot;http://earreverends.com/index.html#downloads&quot;&gt;more than twenty-five pieces / songs&lt;/a&gt; over this last year, and to have received so much positive response. I&apos;m frustrated that I haven&apos;t released more, but I hope that these pieces / songs I&apos;m still keeping in the oven will be better for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was a little more than a year ago that I put up this site&apos;s home page, and posted a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/download/practices/jvb/joi_v_burtonator.mp3&quot;&gt;Joi vs. The Burtonator&lt;/a&gt; (mp3), also today&apos;s musical wrong notes I&apos;ve include with these textual wrong notes. It&apos;s seems weird to me now that I chose that song to have been the first one I released, but &lt;em&gt;c&apos;est la vie&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting&quot;&gt;Podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, depending on how you look at it, may or may not be what I&apos;m doing here by including audio with every post. (Trivia note: I contributed some of the history write-up to the Wikipedia entry on podcasting, and coined the term: proto-podcasting used in that entry.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For most folks, podcasting seems to be about creating or listening to an online talk radio show or audio blog post&amp;mdash;i.e., a program centered around someone (or a group) speaking. And, as such, it&apos;s interesting to hear how folks are using music as part of these.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was flattered to find out that my song, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/download/practices2/ear_reverends_plastic_toys.mp3&quot;&gt;Plastic Toys&lt;/a&gt; (mp3), was featured in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0114670/2004/12/21.html#a637&quot;&gt;Cone 11, Forced Air&lt;/a&gt; podcast (&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejohn_norris_net/podcast/cone11.mp3&quot;&gt;mp3&lt;/a&gt;) by John Norris, whose blog covers the topics of &amp;quot;Art, Information, Ceramics, and You&amp;quot;. (Thanks John!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, upon listening to it myself, I started to wonder how musicians like myself could contribute more than just longer music recordings to the overall production of these &apos;casts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since listening to John&apos;s &apos;cast, I&apos;ve made a point of listening to a variety of others&apos;. And, it seems like there is an assumption-technique being used like: I like this song and think it&apos;ll be cool to have in the background while I talk over it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Music is so much about space (or, silence), which is emphasized through the dynamics of musical tones (or, sounds). And, a recording of your voice (e.g., radio) is also very dependent on space / silence&amp;mdash; more so than folks often realize, as their normal context for speaking is one which includes visual cues and bodily gestures that don&apos;t appear on the audio recording at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, music can add to the dynamic of your voice, and also help mark the progression of your &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;. And, a first suggestion to podcasters out there is that you might consider your podcasts as being made up of several segments / stories that are more in the 30-90 second range of length, rather than as a single 3-4 minute segment / story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Music can then be used to delineate these 30-90 second segments. So, speak for 30-90 seconds, then take a break (let your listeners absorb what you just said) and play a musical interlude for 20-30 seconds. These interludes then can have qualities that reflect (and emphasize) the feeling of what you just said, and also act as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=segue&amp;amp;r=67&quot;&gt;segue&lt;/a&gt; to your next segment /story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, this is a pattern of: voice only, music only, voice only. And, one can use cross-fades (the first notes of music and the last words of the voice occur at the same time, etc.) with a great deal of nuance as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another pattern is to have voice over the music. And, in this way, I think, the speaker really needs to be &amp;quot;singing&amp;quot; in a rhythmic, if not melodic sense (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cmp/g_recitative.html&quot;&gt;recitative&lt;/a&gt;). In other words, the music is not so much in the background (albeit, it&apos;s low in volume) but is an integral component of your vocal expression, and you&apos;re conscious of a groove between your speech phrasing and the musical phrasing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward, I think it might be interesting for musicians to create and release music specifically for these kinds of patterns. (And, actually, one idea I&apos;ve had is taking my un/released pieces of 2004 and producing a bunch of short musical excerpts that could be used in this way.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&apos;m really excited about having my music used in podcasts, but, at the same time, I&apos;d like to make more of this podcast-talk + music format. I mean, it&apos;s kind-of like early radio before recordings were dominant vs the development of recordings that &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; to the traditional radio format. What music recordings can we make that play to the podcasting radio format?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, I&apos;d find it fun to write and record theme music for folks podcasts. That&apos;s another suggestion to podcasters: have a theme song for the intro and end of your show. But, again, it&apos;s got to be 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds long? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Linear communications, like spoken stories or, in general, musical pieces, have a start, middle, and an end. Blog posts often do not have so much structure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it&apos;s interesting to consider the podcast to be like a blog post, because, I think, the audio program (in order to be enjoyable) may have many more structural requirements than the blog post. But, that can be advantageous: you can design a structure or two that can be your podcast formats, and then that structure helps you keep your &apos;casts focused.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And, I&apos;m imagining that music can not only be used to help build these program structures / formats, but that music can be created specifically for this kind of use such that the music and the talk format become more interesting / enjoyable in their combination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, we&apos;ll see what else the Ear Reverends do with music for podcasts. And, if you use the Ear Reverends&apos; music in your podcast, please let me know so I can keep track (and I&apos;ll probably create a page of links to podcasts that use my music).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks so much for all of your support, link love, and for listening to these things we call music! Have a great new year!
