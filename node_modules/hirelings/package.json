(*I'm scared, Sarge.*)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n**TODO:** Need something sensible here. Tests are an example, for now.\n\nAPI\n---\n\n**TODO:** Need something sensible here. Maybe pointer to\n[docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) output from `lib/hirelings.js`?\n\nFrequently Anticipated Questions\n--------------------------------\n\n* Why \"hirelings\"?\n    * It amuses me to pick odd names for projects. Hirelings are the\n      semi-disposable, semi-reliable hired help that players can pick up in\n      role-playing games.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n2.0.
