// This macro indicates the end of text which explains why the page has
// no specification table. It must follow a usage of {{WhyNoSpecStart}},
// with appropriate explanatory text in between. That text may include appropriate
// markup, but should be fairly short and to the point instead of going into
// extreme detail.
//
// Examples:
//
// {{WhyNoSpecStart}}This property has existed since the early days of the
// Web, before anything had a spec. Work is ongoing to attempt to rationalize
// its behavior into a specification.{{WhyNoSpecEnd}}
//
// {{WhyNoSpecStart}}This Firefox OS specific API is not part of any
// specification.{{WhyNoSpecEnd}}
