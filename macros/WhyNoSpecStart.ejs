// This macro indicates the beginning of text which explains why the page
// has no specification table. It must be complemented by {{WhyNoSpecEnd}},
// with appropriate explanatory text inside. The text may include appropriate
// markup, but should be fairly short and to the point instead of going into
// extreme detail.
//
// Examples:
//
// {{WhyNoSpecStart}}This property has existed since the early days of the
// Web, before anything had a spec. Work is ongoing to attempt to rationalize
// its behavior into a specification.{{WhyNoSpecEnd}}
//
// {{WhyNoSpecStart}}This Firefox OS specific API is not part of any
// specification.{{WhyNoSpecEnd}}
